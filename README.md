# Gameboy-Raspberry-Pi
This is a personal project where I made a custom gameboy using a raspberry pi zero.
It runs on retropie, a Linux based operating system, to play various retro games and emulators.

## Parts list:
Raspberry Pi Zero
3rd party gameboy shell and speaker
Original headphone jack, volume wheel, power switch, and buttons
2.8" ILI9341 LCD display
DMG PCB control board
3.7V 1800mAh LiPo battery
TP4056 USB C battery charging board
USB C header for charging
USB hub
USB A header for external peripherals
USB to 3.5mm auxillary audio card
Audio amplifier
Velco strips, to secure the battery

## Results:
The final project can play NES, Gameboy, and GBC games perfectly in 60fps for 6 hours with a full charge. 
Mounting location for raspberry pi allows for easy access to the SD card for debugging and reprogramming.
USB A header allows for easily adding games and keyboard or external controller use.
Mono speaker disconnects when headphones are plugged in, providing stereo sound. 

## Future improvements:
Custom shell to accomodate for more buttons. Preferably a machined one, to practice my design skills for machined parts.
A newer micro computer for more game options and faster boot times.
Wireless connectivity (easily improved with a newer raspberry pi).
Access to the HDMI or other external display methods.
